# TrinketOS

*Welcome, adventurer. The glyphs are aligned. The signal is stable. The vault responds.*

**TrinketOS** is a pixel-art, terminal-style launcher and system shell for Android-based handheld consoles — such as the Retroid Pocket or AYN Odin. Designed specifically for horizontal screens and controller input, it transforms your device into a personal retro station — cozy, themed, and weirdly alive.

## ✨ What makes it special?

- 🌟️ A custom UI that *feels* like a forgotten OS, not a phone launcher.
- 📃️ Modular tabs: combine pages showing apps, text notes, images, file trees, and more.
- 🎮 Fully remappable controls — including D-Pad and volume buttons.
- 🎨 Themed colors and wallpapers, including animated ones.
- 🧩 Trinkets (our name for widgets): clock, calendar, moon phase, dice, music player, and more.
- 🧙 Sprites: animated pixel assistant, ready to greet you.
- 🎩 Hats. Skills. Achievements. Because UI should be a game.

## 📦 Installation

- Download the latest `.apk` file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ismslv/trinketos/releases) or [Itch.io](https://smslv.itch.io/trinketos).
- Install on your horizontal Android handheld (e.g., Retroid Pocket Flip 2).
- Set it as your default launcher (you can always switch back).
- Launch. Tinker. Explore. Wear hats.

## ✏️️ Philosophy

TrinketOS is designed for those who:

- Missed the warmth of early computer UIs.
- Believe their device should feel personal, not mass-produced.
- Want a handheld that feels like an *artifact*, not just another app grid.

No ads. No telemetry. No corporate bloat. Just pixels and passion.
